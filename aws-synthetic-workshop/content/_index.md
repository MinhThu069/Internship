# Synthetic Data Generation Platform with Privacy Preservation

### Overview

In the data-driven era, organizations increasingly rely on large-scale datasets to train AI and machine learning models. However, a major challenge emerges: **how to leverage real-world data without exposing sensitive information** such as addresses, account numbers, or emails.  
This issue slows down research and development, increases operational costs, and raises legal risks — particularly in industries like finance, banking, and healthcare.

The **Synthetic Data Generation Platform with Privacy Preservation** project addresses this challenge by building an automated solution that:
- Generates synthetic datasets **free from Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**.
- Preserves the **statistical properties and analytical value** of the original data.
- Enables **reusability** across different datasets, reducing redundant work.
- Operates efficiently in terms of cost and time, leveraging **AWS services** within the Free Tier.

Designed for both academic and enterprise use, this platform replaces manual anonymization — often time-consuming and error-prone — with an **automated, consistent pipeline** that supports data preprocessing, privacy checks, model training, and evaluation.  

Once implemented, the solution not only accelerates **machine learning model development** but also enables safe data sharing across teams or organizations, fostering collaboration without compromising privacy.
